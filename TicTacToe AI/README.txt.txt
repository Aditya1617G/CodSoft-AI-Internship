Task 2  Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent

This is a simple Python project where I made an **AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe** against a human. The AI uses a search algorithm to make the best possible moves and is almost impossible to beat.


 Project Objective

To understand the basics of AI decision-making using the **Minimax algorithm**. The goal was to make an agent that can play and never lose in a Tic-Tac-Toe game.


 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Minimax Algorithm
- Alpha-Beta Pruning (for faster move calculation)


 How to Run

1. Open the file `tictactoe.py` in any Python IDE (such as IDLE, VS Code, or Pydroid 3)
2. Run the script
3. You will be prompted to enter a move (0 to 8) to place your X
4. The AI (O) will automatically make its move after yours
5. Continue until either player wins or the game ends in a draw
