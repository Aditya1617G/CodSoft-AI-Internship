Task 4 Movie Recommender System (Genre-Based)


Objective:

To build a simple content-based movie recommendation system using Python. The program suggests similar movies based on the genre of a given movie using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.

Concepts Used:

1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert movie genres into numerical vectors.
2. Cosine Similarity to measure how similar two movies are based on genre.
3. Pandas for data manipulation.
4. Scikit-learn for machine learning tools.

How to Run:

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Install the required libraries by running the following command in terminal:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Save the Python script as `movie_recommender.py`.
4. Run the script using:
   python movie_recommender.py
5. When prompted, enter a movie title from the available list:
   - The Matrix
   - John Wick
   - Toy Story
   - Finding Nemo
   - Inception
   - The Godfather
   - Avengers: Endgame
   - Interstellar
   - Shrek
   - The Dark Knight

What I Learned:

- How to represent text data (genres) using TF-IDF vectorizer.
- How to apply cosine similarity for measuring content similarity.
- Basics of building a content-based recommendation system.
- Handling user input and searching within a dataset.
- Practical usage of pandas and scikit-learn libraries.
- How to use fuzzy logic
