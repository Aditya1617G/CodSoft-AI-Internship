# CodSoft-AI-Internship

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my **Artificial Intelligence Internship at CodSoft**.

Through these tasks, I applied AI concepts using Python to solve real-world problems in natural language processing, game development, and recommendation systems.

#  Tasks Completed

 **Task 1 – Rule-Based AI Chatbot:**  
  A simple chatbot that responds to user input using hardcoded patterns and rules. Introduced me to rule-based logic and pattern matching.

 **Task 2 – Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI:**  
  A terminal-based version of the classic game with basic AI logic that allows a player to play against the computer. Helped me understand turn-based logic and board state checking.

 **Task 3 – Movie Recommendation System:**  
  A content-based system that recommends similar movies based on genres using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity. Helped me learn about vector space models and similarity measures in NLP.

# Concepts Used

- Rule-based AI and pattern matching  
- Game development logic using Python  
- TF-IDF text vectorization  
- Cosine similarity for recommendation  
- Use of Python libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`

# Acknowledgement

I would like to thank **CodSoft** for the opportunity to work on these projects.  
This internship helped me practically apply my AI knowledge and build real-world solutions. It was a valuable experience in developing technical skills and project structure.
