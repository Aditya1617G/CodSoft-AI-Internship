Task 1 – Rule-Based AI Chatbot


Objective

To create a chatbot that can hold a basic conversation and answer common questions.  
This helped me understand how chat-based logic flows using conditional statements.



 Concepts Used

- if-else conditions  
- input/output in Python  
- string matching  
- basic conversation logic


 How to Run

1. Open `chatbot.py` in any Python IDE (IDLE, VS Code, Pydroid, etc.)
2. Run the script
3. Type messages like `hello`, `how are you`, `bye`, etc. to interact with the chatbot
4. Type `bye` or `exit` to end the chat


 What I Learned

- How to design simple rule-based interaction systems  
- How to match and respond to text inputs  
- Basics of conversational AI logic
